# **Garden Simulation Project**

This project is a **garden simulation**, written in C++. 

## **Overview**

The codebase is divided into several classes that model different aspects of the garden:

- ### **Garden**
Represents a garden which contains all of the trees. It offers **management capabilities** such as planting and removing trees, simulating the growth of garden, etc.

- ### **Tree**
Depicts a tree within the garden. It encapsulates behaviors related to tree activities, such as growing, fading, and harvesting fruits.

- ### **Branch**
Models a branch on the tree which can grow fruits and manage its own state.

- ### **Fruit**
Represents a fruit on a branch. It possesses methods to manage the fruit's state, including growth, fading and harvesting.

## **Project Origin**

This project was an assignment from university studies. The goal of the assignment was to create an **object-oriented simulation** of a garden with trees, branches and fruits using C++.
